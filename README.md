# HackerRank-30-Days-of-Code
Codes with Python
The start to code is important. It's easy to learn the wrong things or miss critical insights that can be vital in the long run.

In this 30 day code repository based on HackerRank challenge, start with an initial stage and work your way up in complexity. 
By the end of the challenge I hope to feel more comfortable with Python and increase the ability to troubleshoot and tackle any Python issue or project.

Every day I will do practice exercises to review what I have learned.
